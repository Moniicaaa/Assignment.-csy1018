                This website was created as and assignment for course
                CSY1018 (web development). HTML and CSS were used inorder to 
                run and opreate the site.<br> As for the overall layout of the website i went
                for the simple format; which includes a header, main section and the footer.In order 
                to create the layout i proceeded with the basic html tags.
                After the layout was placed i setup a CSS tag which made coding more convinent,
                it helped me a lot in setting up the designing and asthetic aspects of
                the website. With the convenience of css, i chose the basic color pallate for the overall
                site.The color's compatibility was experimented by changing the background and 
                text colors.<br>
                Creating and making the navigation tag operate was the part i enjoyed quite a lot. However,
                linking it to open in all five multiple pages was a little tricky. I had to go through many
                trials and error to make it work.Overall, for me using the hover function and watching it 
                it operate was very pleasing.
                <br> The most difficult problem i faced while creating the website would probably 
                be to have the site be responsive on boyh mobile and desktop devices; it took me a lot of 
                time and effort to get it right.
