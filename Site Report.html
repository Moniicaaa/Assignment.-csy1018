                     While coding the site one of the main problems i faced was being a beginner and missing
                     several little deatils. Due to thoes minor errors the website didn't show the expected results, causing 
                     a lot of recheaking and confusions. The second trouble i had quite the difficulty with was
                     linking the navigations to open it's respective page from the five multiple pages that was created.
                     Finally, the most difficult problem i faced would propbably be to make the site responsive on
                     both mobile and deskstop screens; it tooks me a lot of correcting and researching to get 
                     it right.

                    The major advantage and one of the most helpful part of developing the site was the CSS style sheet. It made the setting
                    up the designingand asthetic aspects of the website much more convinent.
                    Creating and devising the navigation tag to operate was the part i 
                    enjoyed quite much. Also, playing around with the hover function was equally pleasing.
                    As for the best part of the website to work on was the contacts page. Being able to code your own contacts using
                    the contact form, which you can find in the popular daily websites was very exciting and rewarding to watch function.

                    Firstly,the overall layout of the website was created using html and css.
                    I went with a very simple format in hopes of having less complications while working,it 
                    consists of a header, the main section and a footer.After the layout was
                    in place, a basic color palette was chosen for the overall website. It was fun playing around with
                    colors and selecting the ones that complemented eachother. As for the font sizes and 
                    styles, i have included a lot variations. I wanted the letters to be more distinctive as the topics
                    and contenets changed.
